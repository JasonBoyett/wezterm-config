# Wezterm Config
This is my configuration for the [Wezterm terminal emulator](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html). 
I use wezterm as my primary terminal on mac OS and Linux. 
*If you are interested I use [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com) 
with [AwesomeWM](https://awesomewm.org/).*
I do not reccomend using this config directly since it is set up to work specifically with
my system. I reccomend you use it as inspiration to set up your own system with wezterm.

## Dependencies
- [Cascadia Cove Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)

    - I encorage you to support the creator of operator mono but if you can't afford a
    premium font then you can find it for free [here.](https://github.com/ajaybhatia/Operator-Mono/blob/master/src/Operator%20Mono/OperatorMono-BoldItalic.otf)

- [My own background picking script](https://github.com/JasonBoyett/terminal-background-tool)
    - I use this script to automatically change my terminal background with a single command
